Presentation on PMBind, a transformer-based framework for peptide-MHC binding affinity prediction that generalizes over under-resourced MHCs with applications to T-cell dynamics.

## Overview

This presentation covers my master thesis work on developing PMBind, a novel deep learning approach to predict peptide-MHC binding affinities. The work was conducted at the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences under the supervision of Dr. Johannes Söding.

## Key Topics

* **Protein Language Models**: Leveraging pre-trained protein language models for pMHC representation learning
* **Transformer Architecture**: Novel noise-robust transformer architectures for binding affinity prediction
* **Generalization**: Methods to generalize predictions across under-resourced MHC alleles
* **T-cell Dynamics**: Applications of binding predictions to understanding T-cell recognition and response
* **Immunotherapy Applications**: Implications for neoantigen discovery and personalized cancer vaccines

## Technical Highlights

* Integration of ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) protein language models
* Noise-robust architecture design for handling uncertain training data
* Transfer learning strategies for low-data MHC alleles
* Validation on benchmark datasets and comparison with state-of-the-art methods

## Context

This work is part of my M.Sc. thesis in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Georg-August-Universität Göttingen and contributes to the PMGen pipeline for neoantigen generation.
