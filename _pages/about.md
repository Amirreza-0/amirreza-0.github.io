# About Me

I am a Computational Biologist specializing in Deep Learning with an M.Sc. in Computational Biology from Georg-August-Universität Göttingen (GPA 1.6). I develop cutting-edge AI solutions for immunology and healthcare applications.

Currently, I have completed my master thesis at the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences, where I pioneered **PMBind** - a transformer-based framework that does peptide-MHC binding prediction using protein language models and novel noise-robust architectures. This work aims to generalize predictions over under-resourced MHCs, with applications to T-cell dynamics.

In parallel, I work as a Research Assistant at Universitätsmedizin Göttingen on the **FAIrPaCT project**, building federated learning pipelines for pancreatic cancer diagnosis and treatment prediction.

My expertise combines deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow/PyTorch), biological data analysis, and containerized deployment (Docker) to translate AI innovation into therapeutic discovery. I have experience in:

- **Deep Learning & AI**: Transformer models, federated learning, NLP, computer vision
- **Bioinformatics**: NGS data analysis, pathway visualization, omics data processing
- **Programming**: Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Pandas), R (Bioconductor, DESeq2)
- **Specialized Methods**: Protein language models, simulation-based inference, evolutionary algorithms

I am fluent in English (C1), German (B1), and Persian (native), and passionate about applying computational methods to advance personalized medicine and immunotherapy.
