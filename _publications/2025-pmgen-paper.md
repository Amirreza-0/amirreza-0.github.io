## Abstract

PMGen is a comprehensive computational pipeline designed for peptide-MHC (pMHC) complex modeling and neoantigen generation. This tool addresses critical challenges in immunotherapy and personalized medicine by providing accurate structural predictions of peptide-MHC interactions and identifying potential neoantigens for cancer immunotherapy applications.

## Key Features

* **Peptide-MHC Complex Modeling**: Advanced computational methods for predicting the 3D structure of peptide-MHC complexes
* **Neoantigen Generation**: Automated pipeline for identifying and prioritizing potential neoantigens from patient-specific mutation data
* **Integration with PMBind**: Leverages deep learning-based binding affinity predictions using transformer models and protein language models
* **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale analyses across multiple MHC alleles, including under-resourced variants

## Applications

PMGen has significant implications for:

* **Cancer Immunotherapy**: Identification of patient-specific neoantigens for personalized vaccine development
* **T-cell Dynamics**: Understanding T-cell recognition and response mechanisms
* **Drug Discovery**: Predicting peptide-MHC interactions for therapeutic target identification
* **Personalized Medicine**: Enabling precision medicine approaches in oncology

## Status

This work is currently submitted for publication and builds upon the PMBind framework developed during my master thesis at the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences.
